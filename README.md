# One-More

## Description
Documentation for the One More web application that I completed as part of my final year project in UCC, for which I received a final grade of 89%. As mentioned in the documentation, the application adopts a 3-tier architecture, written primarily in Java with a MySQL database.

As a personal development project, I aim to rewrite the application using React / Redux for the front-end, and Node.js / Express.js for the backend. Project will commence in the summer of 2021.
